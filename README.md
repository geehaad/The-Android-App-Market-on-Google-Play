# The-Android-App-Market-on-Google-Play
In this project, you will do a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories.

The data for this project was scraped from the Google Play website. While there are many popular datasets for Apple App Store, there aren't many for Google Play apps, which is partially due to the increased difficulty in scraping the latter as compared to the former.
